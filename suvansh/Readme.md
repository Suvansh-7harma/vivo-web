## Used Tags

In this project, I utilized various HTML tags to structure and organize the content. The use of semantic tags was prioritized to enhance the project's accessibility and search engine optimization. Below is a list of some of the key HTML tags used:

- <div>: Used for non-semantic grouping and styling purposes.
- <p>: Used to structure and format paragraphs.
- <span>: Employed for styling specific inline elements.
- <ul>: Utilized to create an unordered list.
- <li>: Used to define list items within <ul> or <ol>.
- <img>: Utilized for embedding images within the content.
- <picture>: Employed for responsive image handling.
- <a>: Implemented for creating hyperlinks.

The emphasis on semantic HTML not only improves code readability but also contributes to a more meaningful and accessible document structure.

## Learning

Throughout this project, I encountered several learning opportunities:

1. *Semantic HTML Importance*: Recognized the significance of using semantic HTML tags for improved website accessibility and search engine optimization.

2. *Efficient Styling with Flexbox*: Explored and implemented Flexbox for efficient and responsive layout design, making it easier to create complex layouts and align items within a container.

3. *Media Queries for Responsiveness*: Implemented Media Queries to ensure the project's responsiveness across various devices and screen sizes. This allowed for the adaptation of styles and layouts to create a seamless user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

4. *Box Model Units*: Gained a deeper understanding of the box model and its units, such as px (pixels), em (em units), rem (root em units), and percentages. This knowledge facilitated precise control over element dimensions and spacing within the layout.

5. **Inline Styling with <span>**: Utilized <span> for inline styling of specific elements within the content.

6. **List Creation with <ul> and <li>**: Created organized lists using <ul> and <li> tags.
